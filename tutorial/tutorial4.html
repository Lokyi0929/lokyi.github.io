<font face=Times New Roman size=4>
boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.<br>

<br>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf!Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.<br>

<br>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here."
